A java program that uses an XML file with GO-terms (downloadable on
http://archive.geneontology.org/latest-full/go_200911-termdb.obo-xml.gz),
and presents the information in this file as a JTree, that consists of
- level 1: all terms (<term>) in the file, to be visualized by their name (<name>)
- level 2: shows below each term the corresponding <is_a> references as subnodes,
visualized by their GO-identifiers. On double-click on a <is_a> reference the
corresponding <term> in the JTree is put in focus.
