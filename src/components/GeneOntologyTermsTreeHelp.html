<h1>Gene Ontology terms</h1>

This program presents the Gene Ontology terms in a tree format.
<br><br>
The first level shows all the terms, visualzed by their names.
<br><br>
The second level shows their corresponding &lt;is_a&gt; references, identified by their GO-identifiers.<br>
Double-clicking on the &lt;is_a&gt; reference brings the corresponding term in focus.
